##About the\_leftcol

Iâ€™ve stumbled upon many websites adopt left column lately.
I've picked up some of traits on those new left column design web site.

* Strong branding - Logo comes first strongly which lead to stronger branding.
* Near empty - Left column used has navigation in it, but now it only contains little. as little as just a logo.

Most [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) powered websites are personal website and have simple structure.
This is why I decided to build this theme.

###Note
This theme is using HTML5 and CSS3.
I really don't care about IE at all. Not even IE9.(May work just fine)
You can ask me questions but don't expect me to make this compatible with IE.
