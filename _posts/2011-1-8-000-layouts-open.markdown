##What is \_layouts?
\_layouts is created because I've just found out about [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), which is, according to its author, a simple, blog aware, static site generator.
Jekyll is simple but powerful, I can do most of tasks I have to do to manage blog.
I've been using WordPress, in fact I still use it, but I can see myself in future, I use Jekyll as my primal blog tool.
I can use my trusted MacVim to write a post. I still couldn't figure it out, but I could use git to *publish* a post(Can anybody help me on this? Both Official document and Google failed).

\_layouts is created for those who like to try Jekyll. I'm new to ruby so I can't help you with that, but I'm an web designer/front end developer so I provide *themes* to help you.
Theme is like a WordPress theme. You can use it to change your design. While Jekyll have not yet provide WordPress like theming, it's fairly easy to accomplish same thing.
Just clone my theme from github, start up terminal application, go cloned dir and type jekyll --server. You can now preview your new design at http://localhost:4000/
As I learn, I'll share my findings on Jekyll at \_layouts. If you have any tips, I'd be very happy to hear it.

##My design principle
* Minimalist
  
  I love minimalist approach. This allows me to focus on details. I'll always keep design, file structure and code simple as possible.

* I hate IE

  I'm sorry to say, but please let me ignore IE for my personal project. I've had it enough on my day job already.
  Besides, if I care about IE, code will be messy which conflict with my first principle.
  And I don't have Windows PC so that makes it pretty hard for me to check if my design/code is compatible.

##About me
My name is Yuya Saito, I use studiomohawk as my alias on internet. As I've wrote above, I am an web designer/front end developer. I currently live in Tokyo, Japan working for internet based media company in Japan.
I love what I do. I'd love to become better an web designer. That is why I've started this project. I know how to become better in any field. Just do it. Do it a lot.

You may already noticed, English is not my first language so bare with me. I've graduated from University of Nevada, Las Vegas and I majored in print journalism so I try to re-learn how to write in English soon enough.

##Suggestion?
I plan to publish my themes on github so you can use Issue page on github to suggest me.
I have repository for this blog at [github](https://github.com/studiomohawk/_layouts). you can fork me.
