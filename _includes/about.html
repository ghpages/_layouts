<p>
_layouts is a theme gallery for Jekyll powered websites. Themes are created by me, Yuya Saito who is an web designer/front-end developer in Tokyo, Japan.<br>
Unless otherwise noted, themes here are all MIT licenced which means you can do whatever you want as long as you don't sue me. <br>
You can read more detail on my github repository.<br>
And of course, this site is powered by <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">jekyll</a>.<br>
The font I'm using is <a href="http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/fonts/1-junction">Junction</a> via @font-face by <a href="http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/">The League of Moveable Type</a>
