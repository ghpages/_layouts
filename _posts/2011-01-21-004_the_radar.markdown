##About the\_radar

the\_radar is very comprehensive theme. It is made for my personal blog called CSS Radar which will be migrated from WordPress soon.

Unlike other themes I published, it has 4 files in \_layouts directory and to make theme management easier \_includes directory has 7 files.
If you would like to use this theme, please make sure what every file responsible.
I've tried to make this minimum as possible, it might looks complex but once you understand file structure, you are good to go.

This theme(or any other jekyll theme I design) is using HTML5 and CSS3.

###Note
I really don't care about IE at all. Not even IE9.(May work just fine)
You can ask me questions but don't expect me to make this compatible with IE.

###changelog
Refer this at my github.
